# Training pipeline

A training pipeline needs to handle a large volume of data with low costs. One common solution is to store data in a column-oriented format like Parquet or ORC. These data formats enable high throughput for ML and analytics use cases. In other use cases, the tfrecord data format is widely used in the TensorFlow ecosystem.
