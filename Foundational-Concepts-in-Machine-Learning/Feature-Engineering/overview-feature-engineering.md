## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create new features from raw data that make machine learning algorithms work more effectively. This step involves transforming raw data into a format that is better suited for algorithms to work with, which can significantly impact the performance of the final model.

**Key Aspects of Feature Engineering:**

- **Creation:** Involves creating new data inputs from existing data. For example, from raw data points like date and time, you might extract features like day of the week, weekend, and time of day.
  
- **Transformation:** Applying transformations to make the data more useful for models, such as scaling, normalization, or applying mathematical functions.
  
- **Integration:** Combining multiple datasets or synthesizing new information from multiple features, like calculating the distance between two points given their longitude and latitude.
  
- **Complexity:** Often requires domain expertise to understand what transformations or combinations of data might be predictive.
