Derivative vs Partial Derivative

The derivative is for single variable functions, and partial derivative is for multivariate functions. In calculating the partial derivative, you are just changing the value of one variable, while keeping others constant. Geometrically, the derivative of a function can be interpreted as the slope of the graph of the function or, more precisely, as the slope of the tangent line at a point. 

Derivative of a function at a particular point on the curve is the slope of the tangent line at that point, whereas gradient descent is the magnitude of the step taken down that curve at that point in either direction. The gradient is a vector; it points in the direction of steepest ascent.

Directional Derivative Equals $\Delta f$: The expression $D_{\mathbf{d}} f(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{d}$ represents the directional derivative of the function $f$ at point $\mathbf{x}$ in the direction of the vector $\mathbf{d}$. This quantity approximates the change in the function's value, $\Delta f$, when moving a very small distance from $\mathbf{x}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$, assuming $\mathbf{d}$ is sufficiently small. 

Interpreting Positive and Negative Values:

If the result of $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{d}$ is positive, it indicates that the function $f$ is increasing in the direction of 
$\mathbf{d}$ from the point $x$. If the result is negative, it indicates that the function $f$ is decreasing in the direction of $d$ from the point $x$.

The rate of change of the function in any given direction (represented by a unit vector 
$\mathbf{u}$) from that point is given by the directional derivative, which is the dot product of the gradient and $u$. Mathematically, it's expressed as $\nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u}$
