Derivative vs Partial Derivative

The derivative is for single variable functions, and partial derivative is for multivariate functions. In calculating the partial derivative, you are just changing the value of one variable, while keeping others constant. Geometrically, the derivative of a function can be interpreted as the slope of the graph of the function or, more precisely, as the slope of the tangent line at a point. 

Derivative of a function at a particular point on the curve is the slope of the tangent line at that point, whereas gradient descent is the magnitude of the step taken down that curve at that point in either direction. The gradient is a vector; it points in the direction of steepest ascent.

Directional Derivative Equals $\Delta f$: The expression $D_{\mathbf{d}} f(\mathbf{x}) = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{d}$ represents the directional derivative of the function $f$ at point $\mathbf{x}$ in the direction of the vector $\mathbf{d}$. This quantity approximates the change in the function's value, $\Delta f$, when moving a very small distance from $\mathbf{x}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{d}$, assuming $\mathbf{d}$ is sufficiently small. 

Interpreting Positive and Negative Values:

If the result of $\nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{d}$ is positive, it indicates that the function $f$ is increasing in the direction of 
$\mathbf{d}$ from the point $x$. If the result is negative, it indicates that the function $f$ is decreasing in the direction of $d$ from the point $x$.

The rate of change of the function in any given direction (represented by a unit vector 
$\mathbf{u}$) from that point is given by the directional derivative, which is the dot product of the gradient and $u$. Mathematically, it's expressed as $\nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u}$


The gradient vector's direction corresponds to the direction in which the function experiences the greatest increase. The focus here is on the maximum positive change, not the absolute change. The gradient does not point in the direction of the steepest descent (which would be the maximum absolute rate of change if considering both increases and decreases).

 When the unit vector $u$ is aligned with the gradient vector $\nabla f$, the dot product $\nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u}$ will definitely be a positive value, and it will be maximized.

The statement that "the gradient vector points to the direction of steepest ascent" is a convention based on the fact that the gradient gives the direction of maximum positive rate of change. The direction of steepest descent is indeed the opposite of the gradient vector, but when we refer to the direction the gradient points, we're conventionally speaking of ascent.
