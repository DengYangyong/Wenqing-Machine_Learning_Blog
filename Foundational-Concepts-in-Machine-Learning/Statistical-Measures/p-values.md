# Understanding P-Value through Drug Efficacy Comparison

Imagine we have two drugs: Drug A and Drug B. We want to know if there's a difference in their efficacy. Let's delve into how we can use p-values to determine this.

## The Problem with Small Sample Sizes

Giving Drug A to one person and Drug B to another, we notice:

- The person who took Drug A was cured.
- The person who took Drug B was not cured.

**Can we conclude that Drug A is better than Drug B?** No!

Reasons for Drug B's failure could vary:

- An opposing effect due to another drug.
- A rare allergy to Drug B.
- Incorrect dosage or usage.
- A placebo effect benefitting Drug A.

Hence, testing on more individuals is necessary.

## The Role of P-Values

P-values, ranging between 0 and 1, help quantify the confidence in whether Drug A is different from Drug B. A p-value close to 0 indicates a higher confidence in a difference.

### Common Thresholds for P-Values

- **Standard Threshold:** 0.05  
  - Implies that in an ideal scenario with no drug difference, only 5% of experiments would mistakenly suggest a difference.
- **For Critical Decisions:** Smaller thresholds (e.g., 0.00001)  
  - Reduces the chance of false positives but often at a higher cost or effort.
- **For Less Critical Decisions:** Higher thresholds (e.g., 0.2)  
  - Tolerates more false positives for less critical outcomes.

### Understanding through Examples

1. **Identical Drug, Different Outcomes:**

   With a p-value of 0.9, no significant difference is found. However, sometimes due to random variances like allergies or placebo effects, a smaller p-value (e.g., 0.01) might be observed falsely indicating a difference.

2. **False Positives:**

   A low p-value like 0.01 in identical groups indicates a false positive.

## P-Value in Our Experiment

If we calculate a p-value for our drug comparison and find it's **less than 0.05**, we'd conclude Drug A is different from Drug B. However, our experiment resulted in a p-value of **0.24**, leading us to believe there's no significant difference between the drugs.

## Hypothesis Testing and Effect Size

Hypothesis testing tries to determine if two conditions (like drugs) are the same or not. The **null hypothesis** assumes no difference. A small p-value doesn't necessarily mean a large difference in effect:

- A large p-value (0.24) might still show a 6-point difference.
- A small p-value (0.04) could indicate a minor 1-point difference.

**In summary**, a small p-value doesn't imply a large difference in effect between Drug A and Drug B.
