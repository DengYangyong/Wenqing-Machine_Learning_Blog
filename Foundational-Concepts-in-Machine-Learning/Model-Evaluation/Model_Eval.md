**Offline Metrics:**

*Purpose:* To validate and refine models during development before they go live.

*Examples:* Log Loss, AUC (Area Under the Curve) for classification problems; RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for regression and forecasting.

*Advantages:* 
- Safer testing environment.
- No impact on real users.
- Controlled conditions.

*Limitations:* 
- May not fully capture real-world complexities or user interactions.

**Online Metrics:**

*Purpose:* To monitor and optimize models in a live setting.

*Examples:* Click-through rates, conversion rates, user engagement metrics.

*Advantages:* 
- Reflects real-time performance and user interactions.
- Allows for immediate adjustments.

*Limitations:* 
- Riskier as poor performance affects actual users.
- Influenced by external variables.
