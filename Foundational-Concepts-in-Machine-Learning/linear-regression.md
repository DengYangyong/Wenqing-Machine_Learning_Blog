# Linear Regression

Linear regression predicts a dependent variable using one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between them.

## Model:
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$

Where:
- $y$: Dependent variable.
- $x_1, ..., x_n$: Independent variables.
- $\beta_0, ..., \beta_n$: Coefficients.
- $\epsilon$: Error term.

## Objective:
Minimize the squared differences between observed and predicted values.

## Assumptions:
- Linearity between variables.
- Observations are independent.
- Constant error variance.
- In multiple regression, predictors aren't highly correlated.
- Errors are normally distributed.

## Use Cases:
Linear regression is used in various fields and for tasks like predicting sales, estimating growth trends, and as part of more complex machine learning processes.
