# The Big Picture

We can think of a neural network (NN) as a mathematical function which takes an input data $x$ and computes an output $y$:
$y = f_{NN} (x)$

For example, a model trained to identify spam emails takes in an email as input data $x$, and output 0 or 1 indicating whether the email is spam.

The function $f_{NN}$ has a particular form: itâ€™s a nested function. In lecture, we learnt the concepts of network layers. So, for a 3-layer neural network that returns a scaler, $f_{NN}$ looks like this:
$$y = f_{NN} (x) = f_3(f_2(f_1(x)))$$

In the above equation, $f_1$ and $f_2$ are vector functions of the following form:
$$f_l(z) = g_l(W_l \cdot z + b_l)$$

where $l$ is called the layer index. The function $g_l$ is called an activation function (e.g. ReLU, Sigmoid). The parameters $W_l$ (weight matrix) and $b_l$ (bias vector) for each layer are learnt using gradient descent by optimizing a particular loss function depending on the task.

## Understanding the shapes

| Component              | Symbol | Shape               | Description |
|------------------------|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Inputs                 | $A_0$  | $N \times C_{in}$   | When working with neural networks, it's common to process multiple instances of data simultaneously in a batch, for efficiency. Each instance comprises input features of dimension $C_{in}$. Thus, when we handle a batch of $N$ such instances, the input matrix $A_0$ will have the shape $N \times C_{in}$, where $N$ is the batch size and $C_{in}$ is the number of features per instance. |
| Weight Matrix          | $W_0$  | $C_{out} \times C_{in}$ | The weight matrix connecting the input layer to the neurons in the current layer, where $C_{out}$ is the number of neurons in the current layer. The weights in a neural network layer connect the inputs to the neurons (units) in that layer. For a layer to compute its output, it performs an affine transformation on the inputs using a weight matrix and a bias vector. The weight matrix for the first layer, $W_0$, must have a shape of $C_{out} \times C_{in}$, where $C_{out}$ is the number of neurons in the layer and $C_{in}$ is the number of input features. This ensures that the matrix multiplication between $A_0$ and $W_0$ is mathematically feasible. |
| Biases                 | $B_0$  | $C_{out} \times 1$  | The bias vector for the layer, where $C_{out}$ is the number of neurons. The biases are broadcast across the batch during computation. The bias in a neural network layer provides each neuron with an additional adjustable parameter, helping the model to better fit the data. For a layer with $C_{out}$ neurons, the bias vector $B_0$ typically has the shape $C_{out} \times 1$. When added to the linear transformation results, the bias values are broadcast across all instances in the batch, effectively shaping the bias contribution as $N \times C_{out}$ during computation. |
| Pre-Activation Outputs | $Z_0$  | $N \times C_{out}$  | The matrix representing the weighted sums for each neuron across all instances in the batch before the activation function is applied. The pre-activation output $Z_0$ of the layer is computed by applying the affine transformation to the input $A_0$ using the weights $W_0$ and adding the biases $B_0$. The resulting matrix $Z_0$ will have the shape $N \times C_{out}$, representing the weighted sum for each neuron across all instances in the batch before the activation function is applied.|
| Activation Function    | $f$    | -                   | A function applied element-wise to $Z_0$, does not change the shape of the matrix. Common examples include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns. Common choices include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh. The activation function is applied element-wise to $Z_0$, producing the activated output $A_1$ without altering the shape of the matrix. |
| Activated Outputs      | $A_1$  | $N \times C_{out}$  | The output of the layer after applying the activation function, retaining the same shape as $Z_0$. The output of the activation function, $A_1$, retains the same shape as $Z_0$, which is $N \times C_{out}$. This matrix represents the output of the layer after applying the non-linear activation function to each pre-activation value. |
| Final Output           | $Y$    | Depends on task     | The output of the final layer, matching the desired output shape for the task. The shape depends on the number of neurons in the final layer and the task requirements. In a network with multiple layers, $A_1$ from one layer becomes $A_0$ for the next layer, and the process repeats. The output of the final layer, $Y$, should match the desired output shape for the task at hand. If the network consists of a single layer or if we're describing the final layer, then $Y$ is simply $A_1$ from that layer. The shape of $Y$ will depend on the number of neurons in the final layer and the specific requirements of the task (e.g., a single neuron for binary classification or multiple neurons for multi-class classification). |

### Example
**Input Layer ($A_0$)**: We have 5 instances in our batch, each represented by a vector of 4 features. Thus, $A_0$ could look like this:

 $$A_0 = 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0.5 & 0.6 & 0.7 & 0.8 \\
   1.5 & 1.6 & 1.7 & 1.8 \\
   2.5 & 2.6 & 2.7 & 2.8 \\
   3.5 & 3.6 & 3.7 & 3.8 \\
   4.5 & 4.6 & 4.7 & 4.8 \\
   \end{pmatrix}$$

**Weights of the First Layer ($W_0$)**: The weights connecting the input layer to the 6 neurons in the hidden layer form a matrix of shape $6 \times 4$ (since $C_{out} = 6$ and $C_{in} = 4$). Each element $w_{ij}$ represents the weight from the $i^{th}$ neuron to the $j^{th}$ feature of the input. The weight matrix might look something like this:

   $$W_0 = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   w_{11} & w_{12} & w_{13} & w_{14} \\
   w_{21} & w_{22} & w_{23} & w_{24} \\
   w_{31} & w_{32} & w_{33} & w_{34} \\
   w_{41} & w_{42} & w_{43} & w_{44} \\
   w_{51} & w_{52} & w_{53} & w_{54} \\
   w_{61} & w_{62} & w_{63} & w_{64} \\
   \end{bmatrix}$$
   
**Weighted Sums Before Activation ($Z_0 = A_0 \cdot W_0^T$)**: Multiplying $A_0$ by the transpose of $W_0$ ($W_0^T$) gives us the weighted sums for each neuron in the hidden layer for each instance in the batch. The resulting matrix $Z_0$ will have a shape of $5 \times 6$ because we have 5 instances and 6 neurons:

   $$Z_0 = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   z_{11} & z_{12} & z_{13} & z_{14} & z_{15} & z_{16} \\
   z_{21} & z_{22} & z_{23} & z_{24} & z_{25} & z_{26} \\
   z_{31} & z_{32} & z_{33} & z_{34} & z_{35} & z_{36} \\
   z_{41} & z_{42} & z_{43} & z_{44} & z_{45} & z_{46} \\
   z_{51} & z_{52} & z_{53} & z_{54} & z_{55} & z_{56} \\
   \end{bmatrix}$$
   
   The first element $z_{11}$ is calculated as:
   $$z_{11} = (0.5 \times w_{11}) + (0.6 \times w_{21}) + (0.7 \times w_{31}) + (0.8 \times w_{41})$$

   Similarly, for $z_{12}$, which represents the weighted sum for the second neuron of the first instance, the calculation would involve the second row of $W_0$:

   $$z_{12} = (0.5 \times w_{12}) + (0.6 \times w_{22}) + (0.7 \times w_{32}) + (0.8 \times w_{42})$$

   And so on for each element in $Z_0$.


**Biases of the First Layer ($B_0$)**: Now, let's represent the biases for the 6 neurons as a column vector, maintaining the shape $C_{out} \times 1$, where $C_{out} = 6$:

 $$Z_0 = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 \\
   2 \\
   3 \\
   4 \\
   5 \\
   6 \\
   \end{bmatrix}$$
   
**Adding Biases Using Column Vector Addition, broadcasting ($Z_0 + B_0$)**: When we add $B_0$ to $Z_0$, each bias value in $B_0$ is added to every corresponding neuron's weighted sum across all instances in the batch. This operation effectively broadcasts the bias values across each row of $Z_0$, maintaining the original shape of $Z_0$, which is $N \times C_{out}$. The operation can be visualized as follows:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
z_{11}+1 & z_{12}+2 & z_{13}+3 & z_{14}+4 & z_{15}+5 & z_{16}+6 \\
z_{21}+1 & z_{22}+2 & z_{23}+3 & z_{24}+4 & z_{25}+5 & z_{26}+6 \\
z_{31}+1 & z_{32}+2 & z_{33}+3 & z_{34}+4 & z_{35}+5 & z_{36}+6 \\
z_{41}+1 & z_{42}+2 & z_{43}+3 & z_{44}+4 & z_{45}+5 & z_{46}+6 \\
z_{51}+1 & z_{52}+2 & z_{53}+3 & z_{54}+4 & z_{55}+5 & z_{56}+6 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

**Activation Function ($f$)**: We apply a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to each element of the weighted sum matrix $Z_0$. The ReLU function outputs the input value if it is positive and 0 if it is negative. This does not change the shape of the matrix but alters its values. For example, if the weighted sum matrix $Z_0$ after adding biases looked like this:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 2 & -3 & 4 & -5 & 6 \\
7 & -8 & 9 & -10 & 11 & -12 \\
-13 & 14 & -15 & 16 & -17 & 18 \\
19 & -20 & 21 & -22 & 23 & -24 \\
-25 & 26 & -27 & 28 & -29 & 30 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

Applying the ReLU activation function would give us:

$$A_1 = f(Z_0) = \text{ReLU}(Z_0) =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 6 \\
7 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 11 & 0 \\
0 & 14 & 0 & 16 & 0 & 18 \\
19 & 0 & 21 & 0 & 23 & 0 \\
0 & 26 & 0 & 28 & 0 & 30 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$


**Output of the Activation Function ($A_1$)**: The output matrix $A_1$ retains the same shape as $Z_0$ but with the ReLU function applied element-wise. Negative values are replaced with 0, while positive values remain unchanged. In our example, $A_1$ looks like this:

$$A_1 =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 6 \\
7 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 11 & 0 \\
0 & 14 & 0 & 16 & 0 & 18 \\
19 & 0 & 21 & 0 & 23 & 0 \\
0 & 26 & 0 & 28 & 0 & 30 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

**Final Output ($Y$)**: Assuming this is the final layer or we have a single-layer network, the output $Y$ is the same as $A_1$. For multi-layer networks, further layers would transform $A_1$ accordingly, with the final layer's output shape matching the desired output shape, which in this case is determined by the number of neurons in the final layer ($C_{out}$).


# Neural Networks Overview

In this overview, we explore the functionality of neural networks and their capability to model complex relationships, such as varying drug efficacy based on dosage, beyond simple linear fits.

## What is a Neural Network?

Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes or neurons, where each connection represents a parameter (weight or bias) that the network learns during training.

<img src="connection_value.png" alt="connection_value" width="400" height="300"/>

Initially, these parameters are unknown and are determined through a process called backpropagation, fine-tuning them to fit the training data accurately.

<img src="unknown_value.png" alt="unknown_value" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="back_estimated.png" alt="back_estimated" width="400" height="300"/>

In the next part of this series, we will delve deeper into how backpropagation works, but for now, let's assume we have a neural network already trained for our dataset.

### Activation Functions

Within the network, some nodes incorporate activation functions, depicted by curved lines, essential for introducing non-linearity into the model.

<img src="curved_lines.png" alt="curved_lines" width="400" height="300"/>

### Hidden Layers

Hidden layers lie between the input and output layers. The configuration of these layers, including the number of nodes and layers, is crucial in designing a neural network.

<img src="hidden_layers.png" alt="hidden_layers" width="400" height="300"/>

### Model Construction

We'll examine how neural networks utilize activation functions in hidden layers to create and combine various shapes, ultimately fitting a complex model to the data, illustrated by a green squiggle in our example. In this neural network, we have one input node which is dosage, one hidden layer with 2 nodes and one output node which is efficacy.

<img src="add_together.png" alt="add_together" width="400" height="300"/>

#### Dosage and Efficacy Example

Considering a scenario modeling drug efficacy from dosage, we input dosage values into the network, transforming them through layers and activation functions to predict efficacy.

For the lowest dosage (0), the calculation through one path in the network might look like this:

<img src="from_to.png" alt="from_to" width="400" height="300"/>

$(\text{Dosage} \times -34.4) + 2.14 = \text{x-axis coordinate}$

$(0 \times -34.4) + 2.14 = 2.14$

<img src="x_axis_coordinate.png" alt="x_axis_coordinate" width="400" height="300"/>

By applying the softplus activation function, we plot a point on the curve for the corresponding dosage, creating a series of points that form a curve as we vary the dosage from 0 to 1.

<img src="choose_softplus.png" alt="choose_softplus" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="put_dot.png" alt="put_dot" width="400" height="300"/>

The choice of activation function affects the shape of the curve. For instance, using a sigmoid function would yield a different curve.

<img src="choose_sigmoid.png" alt="choose_sigmoid" width="400" height="300"/>

As we increase the dosage to 1, we obtain a curve that represents the model's predictions over the dosage range.

<img src="blue_curve.png" alt="blue_curve" width="400" height="300"/>

The range of values from the activation function is relatively narrow, corresponding to the red box in the graph, shaping the curve.

<img src="narrow_range.png" alt="narrow_range" width="400" height="300"/>

Scaling and transforming these curves through weights and biases in the network allows us to fit complex models to the data. For example, when dosage = 0, the current y-axis coordinate for the blue curve is 2.25, then 2.25*-1.3 = -2.93 which corresponds to this position on the y-axis. And we end up with a new blue curve.

<img src="scale_pos.png" alt="scale_pos" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="new_blue_curve.png" alt="new_blue_curve" width="400" height="300"/>

Now letâ€™s focus on the connection from the input node to the bottom node in the hidden layer. Remember, for -2.52 and 1.29, these values come from fitting the neural network to the data with back propagation. Then same operation as before, we get this orange curve.

<img src="remember.png" alt="remember" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="orange_curve.png" alt="orange_curve" width="400" height="300"/>

Each node in the hidden layer contributes to the final model by creating unique shapes through the activation function, transformed by the network's parameters.

<img src="diff_para.png" alt="diff_para" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="diff_portion.png" alt="diff_portion" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="exciting_shape.png" alt="exciting_shape" width="400" height="300"/>

By scaling and adding these curves together, neural networks can approximate complex relationships within the data.

<img src="new_orange_curve.png" alt="new_orange_curve" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="add_curve.png" alt="add_curve" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="subtract_curve.png" alt="subtract_curve" width="400" height="300"/>


### Making Predictions

Given a specific dosage, the neural network can predict its efficacy by mapping it onto the final model curve, indicating the drug's effectiveness. If someone comes along and says that they are using dosage = 0.5 we can look at the corresponding y-axis coordinate on the green squiggle and see that the dosage will be effective or we can solve for the y-axis coordinate by plugging dosage = 0.5 into the neural network and do the math. And we see that the y-axis coordinate on the green squiggle is 1.03, and since 1.03 is closer to 1 than 0, we will conclude that a dosage = 0.5 is effective.

<img src="BFSFMs.png" alt="BFSFMs" width="400" height="300"/>

### Understanding Weights and Biases

Weights and biases are the parameters that neural networks adjust to fit the model to the data, slicing, flipping, and stretching the activation functions into new shapes.

<img src="weights.png" alt="weights" width="400" height="300"/> <img src="biases.png" alt="biases" width="400" height="300"/>

Note, this neural network starts with two identical activation functions, but the weights and biases on the connections slice them, flip them and stretch them into new shapes, which are then added together to get a squiggle that is entirely new, and the squiggle is then shifted to fit the data.
