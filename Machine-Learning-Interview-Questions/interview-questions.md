## Question 1

**You have come across some missing data in your dataset. How will you handle it?**

**Answer:**

In order to handle some missing or corrupted data, the easiest way is to just replace the corresponding rows and columns, which contain the incorrect data, with some different values. The two most useful functions in Panda for this purpose are `isnull()` and `fillna()`.

- `isnull()`: is used to find missing values in a dataset.
- `fillna()`: is used to fill missing values with 0â€™s.
