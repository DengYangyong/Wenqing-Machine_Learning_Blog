## Question 1

**You have come across some missing data in your dataset. How will you handle it?**

**Answer:**

In order to handle some missing or corrupted data, the easiest way is to just replace the corresponding rows and columns, which contain the incorrect data, with some different values. The two most useful functions in Panda for this purpose are `isnull()` and `fillna()`.

- `isnull()`: is used to find missing values in a dataset.
- `fillna()`: is used to fill missing values with 0â€™s.

## Question 2

**Explain Decision Tree Classification**

A decision tree uses a tree structure to generate any regression or classification models. While the decision tree is developed, the datasets are split up into ever-smaller subsets in a tree-like manner with branches and nodes. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
