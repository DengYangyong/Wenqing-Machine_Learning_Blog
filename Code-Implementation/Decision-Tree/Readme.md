The code is from CMU 10601(Introduction to Machine Learning)'s homework, and I have attached the homework description with code related.

The description starts from **page 14**.

It contains 2 python file one is inspection.py and one is decision_tree.py.
# How to run the code 

```python
python inspection.py small_train.tsv small_inspect.txt
```
```python
python decision_tree.py education_train.tsv education_test.tsv 3 \ edu_3_train.txt edu_3_test.txt edu_3_metrics.txt  
```
```python
python decision_tree.py heart_train.tsv heart_test.tsv 2 \ heart_2_train.txt heart_2_test.txt heart_2_metrics.txt
```
