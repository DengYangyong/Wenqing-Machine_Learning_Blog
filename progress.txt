Covariance.md ❌ need further improvement for pca
Linearity.md❌ need further improvement for why the product of the standard deviations of x and y is normalization? Which is correlated to correlation.

why gradient" refers to a vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase  give specific example???
why the product of the standard deviations of x and y is normalization?
