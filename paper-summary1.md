# Speculyzer: A Trustworthy Neural Program Synthesizer

## Overview

Speculyzer introduces a neural program synthesizer that learns to predict when it can't solve a problem and certifies its correctness with synthesized specifications. The system aims to enhance trust and safety in neural program synthesis.

## Key Features

- **Self-Evaluation**: The method's ability to self-evaluate its solutions is paramount.
- **Trustworthiness**: Emphasizing the importance of trust, especially when deploying such systems in real-world applications like fixing GitHub issues.
- **Certification of Correctness**: The system provides a certificate of the correctness of the synthesized code, similar to how software engineers write test harnesses for new code.

## Methods

### The Approach

1. **Propose Candidate Programs**: The AI tries to come up with possible solutions (code) to a programming problem described in natural language.
2. **Propose Specifications (Specs)**: Alongside the potential solutions, the AI also suggests certain criteria or conditions that a correct solution should meet.

#### Types of Specifications

- **Input-Output Test Cases**: Straightforward examples of expected inputs and outputs.
- **Functional Specifications**: Descriptions of the logical relationships between inputs and outputs.

### Verification Process

The AI checks each solution against its set criteria, providing a form of self-verification.

### Intuition

The goal is to make the AI "check its work", providing solutions and reasons (specs) why it thinks its solution is right.

### Speculyzer in Action

The system synthesizes potential code solutions and generates specifications to validate those solutions. For any given programming task:

1. Uses AI to generate potential code solutions and specs.
2. Checks its solutions against the generated specs.
3. Uses another model to predict if it can solve the problem, which solution is likely correct, and which specs best prove its correctness.

## Results

- Evaluated on the **Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP)** and **HumanEval** datasets.
- Achieved the highest `pass@1` rate on HumanEval, surpassing other methods.
- Demonstrated a significant trade-off between precision and recall, with the capability to achieve 100% precision (zero error rate).

## Generalization

The system showcases near-identical performance when trained on one dataset and tested on another, suggesting robust generalization.

## Certifying Correctness

- The system produces a specification that certifies a program's correctness while offering insight into its behavior.
- Specs are ranked based on distinctiveness, making them more informative and aiding users in determining the correctness of a program.

## Limitations of the "speculyzer" System

- **Inherited Limitations**: Speculyzer is built upon large language models and therefore inherits their limitations, which can range from inaccuracies to biases.
- **Expensive Sampling**: Utilizing large language models introduces significant computational overhead, especially when generating multiple candidate solutions and specifications.
- **Security Concerns**: The method's approach of executing generated code can pose security risks if not properly sandboxed.
- **Trust Level**: While speculyzer adds a layer of trust by self-verifying outputs using specifications, it cannot match the deterministic nature of formal logic-based systems.
- **Ambiguity of Natural Language**: Relying on natural language prompts can sometimes lead to solutions that don't entirely align with the user's intent due to the inherent ambiguity in human language.

## Potential Improvements

- **Optimized Sampling**: Reduce computational costs by improving the sampling methodology, perhaps by leveraging more efficient algorithms or hardware.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Implement stricter sandboxing techniques and security protocols when executing generated code.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine the strengths of formal logic-based synthesizers with neural-based approaches to enhance trustworthiness.
- **Refined Natural Language Processing**: Use advancements in NLP to better decipher user intent and reduce ambiguity in problem descriptions.

## Future Development Directions

- **Integration with Formal Verification Tools**: To enhance trust, integrate speculyzer with formal program verification tools that can mathematically prove program correctness.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Introduce mechanisms to capture user feedback, allowing the system to learn from its mistakes and continually refine its outputs.
- **Richer Specification Types**: Explore the possibility of using more complex and descriptive specification types that can provide better insight into program behavior.
- **Collaborative Synthesis**: Enhance the system's ability to collaborate with human developers in real-time, offering suggestions, modifications, and corrections as code is being written.
- **Expanding Domain Applicability**: Test and refine the system across a broader range of programming problems and domains to ensure its widespread applicability.

By addressing these limitations and focusing on the outlined future directions, the "speculyzer" system can be evolved into a more robust, trustworthy, and widely-applicable tool for program synthesis.

**Key Takeaway**: Speculyzer represents a significant step towards trustworthy neural program synthesis, emphasizing precision, user trust, and self-verification. It's designed to be accurate, transparent, and self-verifying, vital qualities for real-world adoption.
