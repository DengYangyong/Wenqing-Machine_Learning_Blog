# Problem Statement and Metrics for Building a Video Recommendation System

## Video Recommendations

### 1. Problem Statement
The goal is to build a video recommendation system for YouTube users to maximize engagement and suggest new types of content. The system aims to:

- Increase user engagement.
- Introduce users to new and diverse content.

### 2. Metrics Design and Requirements

#### Metrics

**Offline Metrics:**

- **Precision:** The ratio of relevant videos recommended to the total recommended videos.
- **Recall:** The ratio of relevant videos recommended to the total relevant videos available.
- **Ranking Loss:** A metric to measure the error in the predicted order of recommended videos.
- **Logloss:** A measure of the accuracy of the probabilistic predictions.

**Online Metrics:**

- **Click Through Rates (CTR):** The ratio of users who click on a recommended video to the total users who see the recommendation.
- **Watch Time:** The total time users spend watching the recommended videos.
- **Conversion Rates:** The ratio of users who perform a desired action (e.g., subscribing to a channel) after watching the recommended videos.

#### Requirements

**Training:**

- **Frequency:** Train the model multiple times a day to capture temporal changes, as user behavior can be unpredictable, and videos can become viral quickly.
- **Throughput:** Ensure the training process can handle high volumes of data efficiently.

**Inference:**

- **Latency:** Recommendations must be generated within 200ms, ideally under 100ms, for each user visit to the homepage.
- **Balance:** Find the right balance between exploration (showing new content) and exploitation (showing historically relevant content). Over-exploitation of historical data can prevent new videos from being exposed to users.

### Summary

| Type       | Desired Goals                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Metrics**| Reasonable precision, high recall                  |
| **Training**| High throughput, ability to retrain frequently    |
| **Inference**| Latency from 100ms to 200ms, flexible exploration vs. exploitation control |

The recommendation system should ensure a balance between providing relevant content and introducing fresh content to keep the users engaged and discovering new videos. The system needs to be responsive and adaptable to the rapidly changing user preferences and viral trends.
